Why Make Schedule?

1. You can have overview of everything what you have to do
2. It can work as a remainder and you will be constantly knowing what to do
3. You can have analysis of how it is going
4. You will learn how to manage time
5. You will develop one good habit
6. You will learn how to analysize

Why don't I make schedule ?

1. Because It takes effort 
Ans: If it takes effort does that mean I shouldn't do it, or do I just want to be at the same level.

2. Because it doesn't work the way I think?
Ans: It means you want to be at the same level every time becuase In beginning nothing will work the way you want but you will have to learn , observe analysise

3. Because I think it just waste my time, it doesn't help in any way
Ans: I think if you don't make schedule , you waste more time here and there not knowing what and how to do. You can spend more times on things that are not that much required in comparisont to things which are very required.

The first thing is that whenever you will go to bed, you should spend some time analysing.
